## How to Run App
1. First install XAMPP and get the sql file named `spartan-auction.sql` from the files.
2. Open up your IDE and run the program.
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ to get to the home page.
4. From there you can use the app properly.
5. There are a few users you can use out of the gate.
    - Username: `impoptic` Password: `password` User-Type: `user`
    - Username: `shademap` Password: `password` User-Type: `user`
    - Username: `johnmclean` Password: `password` User-Type: `admin`
    - Username: `admin` Password: `admin123` User-Type: `admin`

### A Few Notes
- Some of the users in the already added database do not have encoded passwords. You can bypass this by copying the already encoded passwords and replacing the non encoded passwords.
- All of the encoded passwords are password
- Sometimes XAMPP is a bit glitchy so it might cause less of a headache if you just run the project without the database, and then take the sql and open it in a text file. From there just copy over the insert commands of the database. The oreder is user > review > auction > review_completed > reply > bid. This order allows you to avoid foreign key constraints.
